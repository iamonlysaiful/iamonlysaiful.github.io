# Saiful's Personal Website

This website is created to showcasing my personal updates and activity and sharing my experiences in web.

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator based on Go, and uses the theme [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) with theme customizations. The site is deployed with GitHub, allowing Git-based continuous deployment.

## Instructions

Guidelines for adding content and documentations for custom html templates can be found in the [reference guide](REFERENCE-GUIDE.md) and the [how-to guide](HOW-TO-GUIDE.md).
